	<div class="wrapper">
			<p> The game is played up and down a rink.  In "singles", each player plays four bowls.  In "pairs", for each end, each player plays four bowls - the first player on each side bows all four bowls and then the second player bowls four bowls.   In "triples", three players play three bowls each.  And in "fours" or "rinks", four players play just two bowls each.  A player must stand with one foot on a centrally placed small black mat, 24 x 14 inches while bowling. 

		The mat is placed by the player who starts.  For the first leg, it is placed four yards in from the ditch, thereafter it is placed anywhere more than 2 1/2 yards in from the near ditch and more than 25 yards from the far ditch.  Once the end is over, the mat is moved to the other end of the rink and play starts in the reverse direction. 

		The jack must go at least 23 yards, must stay within the rink and must not fall into the ditch.  If it is within 2 1/2 yards of the ditch, it is moved back so that it lies 2 1/2 yards in from the ditch.  Before the first bowl is thrown, the jack is always carefully centred to the middle line of the rink. 

		A bowl that falls into the ditch is out of play unless it is a "toucher" meaning that it has previously touched the jack during the end.  To keep track of this, any bowl that touches the jack is marked with a cross using chalk.

		If the jack is knocked into the ditch by a toucher, it is still in play and its location is marked by a small white peg on the bank above the ditch.  No subsequently played bowls can become touchers - if they touch the jack in the ditch, they are still considered to be out of play. </p>
